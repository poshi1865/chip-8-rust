Okay here is the strat to parsing opcodes:

Take an instruction, AND it by 0xF000. This will give us a value where I can look at the first bit and branch out from there.


To get the 1st part of the instruction:
(instruction AND 0xF000) >> 12

2nd part:
(instruction AND 0x0F00) >> 8

3th part:
(instruction AND 0x00F0) >> 4

4th part:
(instruction AND 0x000F)
