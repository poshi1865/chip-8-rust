This program is going to take a ROM as input.

We create a virtual RAM (4kb).
	- We load the ROM into this virtual memory, starting at address 200. Some programs expect this.

	- We also load font data into addresses 050â€“09F. (Anywhere in the first 512 bytes is fine).

We create a display.
	- 64 x 32 pixels.

We also need a stack.
	- 16 2-byte entries long.
	- This can be stored in our emulated memory or we can just create a variable and store it outside.

We need 2 registers as timers.

Then we run a fetch-decode-execute cycle.
